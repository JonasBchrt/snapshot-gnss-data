*TODO*

##Dependencies

The code was tested with *Python 3.7.10 on Ubuntu 18 and macOS Big Sur and* with Python 3.7.7 on Windows 10.

The basic functionality requires `numpy`. In addition, working with ground truth data requires `pymap3d` and `shapely`. You can install all three packages them via `pip`

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
